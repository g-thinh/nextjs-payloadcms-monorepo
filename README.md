# Next.js + PayloadCMS Monorepo Template

## About

This is a template repository for a full stack application built with:

- [PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/), a config-based and code-first CMS application framework.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework built and deployed in Vercel.
- [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/), a feature from the Yarn package manager to create a monorepo architecture.

## Why use these technologies?

PayloadCMS and Next.js are powerful application frameworks in their own rights, and with the right tooling/libraries both offer an amazing developer experience through linting, strong E2E typings, and shareable React components, all in a single repository using Yarn Workspaces.

## What is this template for?

I wanted to couple a Next.js frontend with a CMS to not only manage my content in an intuitive, code-first approach, but also have the ability to use packages from the Express ecosystem.
